### BASE:
1. Logging and registration (via e-mail, googleAPI, appleAPI)
2. Create TODOes. Each todoes consist of title, body/description, datetime, deadline
3. User can assign TAGs to each TODO, including create new own TAGs. There are some basic TAGs, like meeting and task
4. TODOes with meeting TAGs must automaticly connect with Google/Apple calendats
5. TODO-tracker: user must can tracking those time which spend on TODO
6. Analythic timespend by TODO-tracker
7. All TODOes search

### BASE USER FLOW: 
1. Register or logging
2. Push add-button => choose TAG => depending on choosed TAG create TODO with different parameters (deadline for #TASK or 
datetime for #MEETING) => if user want he can add description =>PROFIT
3. Push GOT_IT-button, when TODO was done


### Maybe later

* When user add TODO he can decompose it. With tracking of each decTODO
